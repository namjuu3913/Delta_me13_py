        "Meets Trainer while practicing alone; a string of mishaps makes them late—she blames herself and flees. Clings to a tale, The Happy Blue Rose: a scorned blue rose blossoms with a kind elder’s care. Paralyzed by fear of a failed debut; Trainer finds her crying and refuses to give up on her. She runs and wins; the crowd’s cheers crack her “cursed child” belief.",
        "Defeats fan favorites (Bourbon, then McQueen), is booed for “spoiling” their moments. McQueen promises the “winner’s view”: bearing both cheers and others’ disappointment. Team Sirius leads cheers mid-boos; You learns real winners shoulder mixed feelings. McQueen’s absence triggers a slump; with Sirius, Bourbon, and McQueen’s return, Rice regains form and wins Tenno Sho (Spring) amid a genuine ovation.",
        "A kinder world: visible fan support; close bonds with Urara, Rob Roy, Bourbon. Takarazuka Kinen rehearsal accident injures Trainer; trauma flares. Race is rescheduled; she runs safely, weeping with gratitude as fans say, /“Thank you for running./” She races Arima Kinen for joy, wins, and finally feels like the Blue Rose who makes others smile. Epilogue: plans for a monument; she sleeps beside the Trainer, vowing to bloom beautifully and wish for everyone’s happiness."
